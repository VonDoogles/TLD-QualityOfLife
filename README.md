# Quality Of Life
A mod for The Long Dark that makes several changes to the UI in hopes to make the game more consistent and easier to control.  Also contains some options to make the game more difficult.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I used MelonLoader v0.7.1 for testing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Quality Of Life requires the ModSettings mod to be installed.  (https://tldmods.com/)

> [!WARNING]
> When using **Cat Tail Calories**, calorie count for inventory is saved.  Before removing/disabling this mod, set Cat Tail Calories back to Default and save the game.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Pickup With Contents** in QoL v1.12.0 caused this mod to handle save/load for items in a Travois while in your inventory.  Before disabling the option or this mod, MAKE SURE all Travois in your inventory are empty and save, or save with QoL v1.13.0 or newer!  Otherwise you WILL loose all items inside such Travois!  This does not affect Travois that are deployed in the world.
